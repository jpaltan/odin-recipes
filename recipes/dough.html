   <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300 grams flour</li>
        <li>220 grams water</li>
        <li>5 grams instant dry yeast</li>
        <li>9 grams salt</li>
        <li>oil as needed</li>
    </ul>
            
    <h3>The steps:</h3>
            <ol><li>In a stand mixer fitted with the dough, combine flour, yeast, and salt.</li>
                <li>Stir to combine, then add water. Mix on low speed until dough comes together in a rough ball, then shut off the mixer and let rest for ten minutes.</li>
                <li>Continue mixing at medium-low speed until the dough forms a smooth, silky ball ,about 10 minutes longer. It should stick to the bottom of the bowl rather than riding around the edges.</li>
                <li>Remove dough hook, form dough into a tight ball, set in the bottom of the mixer bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until the dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.</li>
            
            </ol>
